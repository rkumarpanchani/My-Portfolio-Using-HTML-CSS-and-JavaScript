# My-Portfolio-Using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript
My Portfolio Website

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design my portfolio based application.

I am fan of Ubuntu fonts, so here is the link: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu
Select, the font and I paste it in CSS sheet
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Ubuntu:wght@300&display=swap');

To generate random image, I used this link:
